### **Part 2 of my Favorite anime Series**
1. *Slam Dunk*
- Hanamichi Sakuragi is a delinquent and the leader of a gang. He is very unpopular with girls, having been rejected an astonishing fifty times. In his first year at Shohoku High School, Sakuragi meets Haruko Akagi, the girl of his dreams, and is overjoyed when she is not repulsed or scared of him like all the other girls he has asked out. Haruko, recognizing Sakuragi's athleticism, introduces him to the Shohoku basketball team. Sakuragi is reluctant to join the team at first, as he has no prior experience in sports and thinks that basketball is a game for losers because his latest rejection was in favor of a basketball player. Despite his extreme immaturity and fiery temper, he proves to be a natural athlete and joins the team, mainly in the hopes of impressing and getting closer to Haruko.
2. Hunter x Hunter
- Hunter × Hunter is an anime television series that aired from 2011 to 2014 based on Yoshihiro Togashi's manga series Hunter × Hunter.
